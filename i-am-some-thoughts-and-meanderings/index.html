Thoughts and Meanderings</p><p></p><p>So, is what I am
wholly defined by what I am not?</p><p></p><p>Is it simply a case of location through
binary opposites?</p><p></p><p>I think not, how can you orient yourself
anywhere in the physical or elsewhere without another point of reference for your
triangulation. There must be a third, a marriage of the three, and this is why
I think any trinity has power.</p><p></p><p>Having read all our wonderful offerings
times over, including Olivia’s latest
(I’m still looking
forward to your’s
Andreas) having had the conversation with Martin recently and on reading his
recent post, I too have been thinking amid and outside of the chaos of the hospital’s self imposed auspices.</p><p></p><p>What use is a poem such as “I am”in both it’s
writing and its reading if it’s not to
re-enforce those atrophied childhood tendrils of intuition. Delicate, but as
robust as spiders silk, they were never wrong.</p><p></p><p>Even after decades of occupation in the dryer
colonized land of my own older years (I hesitate to use the word adulthood here)
these spindled tendrils are watered and replenished almost instantly by the
simple act of writing. All by pondering deeply on what I am, what I am not and
what binds them.</p><p></p><p>Those little seeds that were planted into
our little palms before we came here sprouted leaves in the act of writing
these little poems I swear it. Now they strive both upwards toward the light
and downwards into the dark soil, becoming in and of themselves, through the
act of writing, thinking and dreaming, this third and final piece in our own
local holy trinity. </p><p></p><p>There are some simple and ancient Tai Ji
exercises involving the breath and simple arm movements that the translator Thomas
Leary calls “uniting
Heaven and Earth”. This
is what we did with these poems. Incredible isn’t it? Im getting tingles just thinking about how big a thing it
really is. </p><p></p><p>Please indulge me in my excitement as I
write because that’s not
just it, things get bigger. </p><p></p><p>In part, all of these poems are longing, a
desire for the connection we cultivate all too infrequently (speak for yourself
I hear you say). But I know the struggle and I can see in your own trustworthy
confessions you know it too in all the relative scenarios that have come and in
those yet to pass.</p><p></p><p>I sense also that paradoxically these poems
were written in that place of fleeting connection, that place between worlds,
or in another one entirely, or from some memory of it, yours or not.</p><p></p><p>Maybe the entire exercise, the last year,
the Myth School, and more, was initiated by the Good and Gracious Great Mother
herself, and all the lesser Gods that dwell inside her. </p><p></p><p>I love to ponder on it in this sense and it
feels important to do so (did you know that the ancient Rishi’s of the Indian sub continent
classified 11 human senses as a pose to the West’s 5 and the much ridiculed 6th. Sight, sound, smell,
taste, touch, the mind, all four of our limbs and the gut.) I mean sense in
this way, a deep and bodily sense.</p><p></p><p>Experiencing in this way removes me from
the colonized arrogance that “I am” the sole pilot of my days. At the age
of 37 the Mother of Mothers is still persevering with me and unceasingly leads
me out in ways that is both bitter and sweet soul music. All that happens, all
that is happening seems to have purpose, though it’s almost impossible to see it whilst in the scrum of life.</p><p></p><p>I recall Joseph Campbell talking in a
series of interviews with Michael Toms that I listened to recently. He remembers
a paper by Schopenhauer called “An
apparent intention of the fate of the Individual“. Campbell says this about it: “ In the later years of life you can look back and see it almost as
orderly as a composed novel, and just as in Dickens stories, little accidents
and meetings turn out to be the main features of the plot, so in your life,
funny little accidents and what seemed to be mistakes at the time turn out to
have been directive crises in your life. Schopenhauer then asks“who wrote this novel? ” followed by, “Can anything happen to you for which you are not ready?”</p><p></p><p>This is no real balm for the pains and
sorrow we experience now, but to know that these things are not malicious of their
own volition, that they too have a trajectory, a rise and fall, gives us a mote
of possibility that to “keep
going” is not an
entirely futile and blind step into the unknown darkness. Though keen and sharp
our wits must still be for this kind of endeavor, could Hope be this power
beyond the highs and lows, the binary opposites? Could it be the something that
has a different orbit entirely of its own but includes you and me in it? Is
Hope the presence of the sacred?</p><p></p><p>The gravitational steadfastness I feel
specifically located in certain parts of my body when time allows is all I need
to know she is present. The signs may be different for every one of us, but I
think to know it is a large amount of work that has its reward. The gossamer
thin golden thread spun out from the centre of all things and which each one of
us hangs upon is made more robust by this work, this practice, this way of
seeing.</p><p></p><p>In my limited and stretched out adolescent
experience of life, I am beginning to perceive that with each faithful step
this Hope that Martin speaks of slowly turns her face and gazes back toward me.
</p><p>I’ve spent a long time deeply averse to the very existence of hope,
especially within the medical circles it as a word is so spellbound to. The
notion of preserving life at any cost, the path of a crusading cure finding
parent, regailed in all of its war-like speak has never attracted me, has never
lured my inmost fears.</p><p></p><p>This Hope, this rooted Hope that springs up
from the Earth herself, is the intuition that I realize now has always threaded
through my days, </p><p>and it whispers to me
now </p><p>“Yes this place,
yes these people, these books, those words". Maybe its something we can only behold at a certain time of life,
or when you’ve taken
so many shield blows your guard is finally down.</p><p></p><p>So I am now re-aquainting myself with her
presence inside of my cells, as a guiding principle, as a compass that signals
toward a “True North”. </p><p></p><p>It amounts to a submission on my part, to
the very fact that there are greater powers swirling around me. I write this
amid the Friday night hubbub of Bristol City centre with sirens, traffic and revelry
all around me. I would do well to remember her more often this Hope, this
intricately woven knot of love and kindness on an unfathomable scale. Not as a
believer or a blind clinger on to the notion of “anything but this”. But to
a solidity that is more than “I am”, a foundation from which “ I ” might spring forth, and that there is a purpose, if only I have the
eyes and humility and one day the wisdom to behold it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thank you for your poetic gifts. </p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">This That We Have Now</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
